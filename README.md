# Computational Geometry Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects focused on computational geometry. Each project explores various algorithms and techniques used in the field of computational geometry.

## What is Computational Geometry?

Computational geometry is a branch of computer science that deals with the study of algorithms and data structures for solving geometric problems. It involves the development and analysis of efficient algorithms to solve problems such as geometric transformations, convex hulls, triangulations, point location, intersection detection, and many others. Computational geometry finds applications in areas like computer graphics, robotics, computer-aided design (CAD), geographic information systems (GIS), and more.
